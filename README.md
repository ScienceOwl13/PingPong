# PingPong
### Stuff To Be Added:

- [ ] Bottom block with buttons `reset`, `new game`, &c.
- [ ] Buttons for testing the site, which can be toggled/hidden, including `winner = false;`.
- [ ] A pop-up screen when first launched (that can be toggled on/off with a bool variable) to explain how it works and the controlls.

### Improvements

- [ ] Have a way to indicate whos serve it is
    - [ ] Buttons that say "player 1" or "player 2" will serve first.
